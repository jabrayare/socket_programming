# Socket Programming

This project is designed to help understand the internals of Internet network communications. We’ll do this by building both client and server List Manager application to use as a testbed for observing and using the Internet (TCP/IP) communication stack that is built into most modern Operating Systems.

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Server must accept and respond to a minimum of five (5) different commands. i.e add, list, delete, replace, exit, and help.
- [x] Create a log of received commands and responses sent.
- [x] Create a configuration file or command line arguments to set the network port on which the server application will “listen”. (Best practice)
- [x] Server application must display a status message that includes the port on which it is listening
- [x] Detect Invalid commands, and respond accordingly

The following **bonus** features are implemented:

- [x] Multi-threading -> Allow multiple client connections simultaneously
